# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Analysis & Price Prediction using Python

This project focuses on analyzing stock market trends and predicting stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques.

---

##  Key Highlights:

- **Trend Analysis**  
  - Detected **bullish trends** (2020â€“2022) and **slight downtrend** (2022â€“2023)  
  - Analyzed **Golden Cross** and **Death Cross** to identify market entry/exit signals

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Calculated technical indicators:
    - 50-day & 200-day Moving Averages
    - Daily Returns
    - Volatility

- **Visual Explorations**  
  - Correlation Matrix  
  - Pairplots for multivariate analysis  
  - Price movement visualization

- **Model Building**  
  - Built a **Linear Regression Model** using:
    - `50_MA`, `200_MA`, `volatility`, `daily_returns` as features
  - Evaluated with:
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - RÂ² Score  
  - Plotted predictions vs actual closing prices
